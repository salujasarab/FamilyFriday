The project consists of main and test packages.

1) Main Package

The main package consists of the following files:

1) FamilyFriday.java - Main file which parses the command line args like add, generate and help and takes respective actions.

2) Generator.java - Generates groups and assigns members to groups.

3) Group.java - Represents a group of members.

4) FridaySeed.java - Generates a seed to feed to the random. This makes sure that if anyone runs the cli gets the same output.

Highlights:
> The cli could be run by any one and any number of times for the given friday. 
> The result would be consistent. This is handled by generating a unique seed for that particular friday.

2) Test Package

The test package contains TestLunch.java class. The test validates that all the members were assigned to group or not.
